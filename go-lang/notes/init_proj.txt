1) Open project path in terminal
2) Run 'go mod init <module/name of project path>'
3) All code must belong to a package; first statement in Go file must be 'package...'
4) Need to declare an entrypoint for the compiler (This will be the main function Go will look for when executing the app)
    - Can only have 1 main function per app
    - Executing logic needs to be within main func
    - To see which functions are available from which packages, you'll need to look them up and read the docs
5) Execute the file with 'go run <file name>'
